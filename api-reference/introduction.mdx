Fordje Connect is a RESTful API that provides programmatic access to AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) data, code requirement data points, reports, and saved collections. All endpoints return JSON and are versioned under `/v1/`.

## Base URL

```
https://connect.fordje.com
```

## Authentication

Every request to a `/v1/` endpoint must include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/ahjs" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

API keys are managed through the Fordje platform. See the [Authentication guide](/authentication) for details on key management and security best practices.

## Endpoints

### AHJs

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/ahjs` | List AHJs in your subscription |
| `GET` | `/v1/ahjs/{ahj_id}` | Get full detail for a single AHJ |

### Data Points

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/data-points` | Query data point values with filtering |
| `GET` | `/v1/data-points/types` | List available data point type definitions |

### Reference Data

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/categories` | List categories (e.g. Electrical, Plumbing) |
| `GET` | `/v1/units-of-measure` | List units of measure for data point values |

### Reports

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/v1/reports/matrix` | Generate an AHJ x data point comparison grid |
| `POST` | `/v1/reports/export` | Export a comparison report as CSV |

### Collections

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/collections` | List your organization's saved collections |
| `GET` | `/v1/collections/{collection_id}` | Get a collection's definition |
| `GET` | `/v1/collections/{collection_id}/data` | Execute a collection against AHJs |
| `POST` | `/v1/collections/{collection_id}/export` | Export collection results as CSV |

## Response format

All successful responses use a standard envelope:

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Human-readable result summary",
  "data": { ... },
  "warnings": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `response_type` | string | `"success"` or `"error"` |
| `description` | string | Human-readable summary of the result |
| `data` | object | The response payload |
| `warnings` | array or null | Access warnings when some requested AHJs were excluded (see below) |

### Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results. Control pagination with `page` and `page_size` query parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `page` | integer | `1` | Page number (1-indexed) |
| `page_size` | integer | `100` | Items per page (max 500) |

Every paginated response includes a `pagination` object in `data`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "items": [...],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 100,
      "total": 142,
      "total_pages": 2
    }
  }
}
```

### Access warnings

When a request includes AHJ IDs that your subscription doesn't cover, the API returns data for the authorized AHJs and includes a `warnings` array:

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "data": { ... },
  "warnings": [
    {
      "code": "AHJ_ACCESS_DENIED",
      "message": "Your subscription does not include the following AHJs",
      "excluded_ahj_ids": [45, 89]
    }
  ]
}
```

Single-AHJ endpoints (`/v1/ahjs/{id}`) return `403` outright if the AHJ isn't in your subscription.

## Error handling

Error responses follow the same envelope with additional fields:

```json
{
  "response_type": "error",
  "description": "Access denied",
  "error": "AHJ_ACCESS_DENIED",
  "status_code": 403
}
```

### Status codes

| Code | Meaning | When it happens |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `401` | Unauthorized | Missing, invalid, expired, or revoked API key |
| `403` | Forbidden | AHJ not included in your subscription |
| `404` | Not found | Resource doesn't exist or doesn't belong to your organization |
| `422` | Validation error | Invalid request parameters (details in `details` array) |
| `429` | Rate limited | Too many requests — see Rate Limits below |
| `500` | Server error | Unexpected internal error |
| `502` | Bad gateway | Backend service unavailable |

## Rate limits

Requests are rate-limited per API key across three windows:

| Window | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Per minute | 60 |
| Per hour | 1,000 |
| Per day | 10,000 |

Every response includes rate limit headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the current window resets |

When the limit is exceeded, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`. See [Rate Limiting](/concepts/rate-limiting) for strategies on handling limits.
