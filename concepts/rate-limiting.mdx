description: "Default rate limits and how to handle them"

Fordje Connect enforces rate limits per API key to ensure fair usage and platform stability.

## Default limits

| Window | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Per minute | 60 requests |
| Per hour | 1,000 requests |
| Per day | 10,000 requests |

## Response headers

Every response includes rate limit headers so you can track your usage:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the current window resets |

## Handling 429 responses

When you exceed a rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "response_type": "error",
  "description": "Rate limit exceeded.",
  "error": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "status_code": 429
}
```

Check the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header to determine when you can resume requests.

## Best practices

- **Use pagination efficiently** — Request larger page sizes (up to 500) to reduce total requests
- **Cache responses** — Reference data like trade groups and units of measure change infrequently
- **Implement backoff** — When receiving a 429, wait until the reset time before retrying
- **Monitor headers** — Track `X-RateLimit-Remaining` to proactively slow down before hitting limits
- **Use bulk endpoints** — Prefer `GET /v1/data-points?ahj_ids=1,2,3` over individual AHJ requests
