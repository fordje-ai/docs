description: "Professional disciplines that organize data points — filter to the categories that matter for your work"

Categories are professional disciplines that organize data points into logical groupings. Every data point type in Fordje belongs to one or more categories — Electrical, Plumbing, Mechanical, Building, Fire, and others. They give you a way to scope your queries to the discipline you care about, so you are not sifting through thousands of unrelated requirements.

When you are building an integration around electrical permitting, you do not need plumbing data in your response. Categories let you express that intent directly in the API call.

## Available categories

Each category contains data point types that fall under that professional discipline. Here are some examples:

| Category | Example data points |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Electrical** | Permit required for electrical work, panel upgrade requirements, inspection frequency |
| **Plumbing** | Backflow preventer requirements, water heater permit requirements |
| **Mechanical** | HVAC permit requirements, duct insulation standards |
| **Building** | Minimum insulation R-value, fire sprinkler requirements, re-roofing permit requirements |
| **Fire** | Fire sprinkler requirements, smoke detector standards, fire alarm requirements |

<Info>
  This list is not exhaustive. Use the `GET /v1/categories` endpoint to retrieve the full, up-to-date list of categories programmatically.
</Info>

Note that some data point types appear in more than one category. Fire sprinkler requirements, for example, are relevant to both the Building and Fire disciplines.

## How categories help you

Categories solve a practical problem: the Fordje platform tracks a large number of data point types across every discipline. If you query data points for an AHJ without any filtering, you get everything — electrical, plumbing, mechanical, building, fire, and more. For most integrations, that is far more data than you need.

By passing `category_ids` when you query data points, you tell the API to return only the data points that belong to those disciplines. This keeps your responses smaller, your parsing simpler, and your application focused on the requirements that actually matter for the work at hand.

<Tip>
  If you know the exact questions you need, filter by `data_point_type_ids` instead. Categories are best when you want everything within a discipline without having to enumerate individual types.
</Tip>

## Listing categories

To see all available categories, call the categories endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/categories?page_size=10" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Retrieved 5 category(ies)",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      { "id": 1, "name": "Electrical" },
      { "id": 2, "name": "Plumbing" },
      { "id": 3, "name": "Mechanical" },
      { "id": 4, "name": "Building" },
      { "id": 5, "name": "Fire" }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 10,
      "total": 8,
      "total_pages": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Each category has an `id` and a `name`. Use the `id` when filtering data points or defining collections.

## Filtering data points by category

Pass one or more category IDs to the data points endpoint to narrow your results to a specific discipline. For example, to get electrical data points for a specific AHJ:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points?ahj_ids=1&category_ids=1&page_size=5" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Retrieved 3 data point(s)",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 2010,
        "ahj": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "City of Los Angeles",
          "type": "city",
          "state_code": "CA"
        },
        "data_point_type": {
          "id": 10,
          "name": "Permit Required",
          "description": "Whether a permit is required for electrical work",
          "unit_of_measure": "boolean"
        },
        "value": "Yes",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
      },
      {
        "id": 2011,
        "ahj": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "City of Los Angeles",
          "type": "city",
          "state_code": "CA"
        },
        "data_point_type": {
          "id": 14,
          "name": "Panel Upgrade Requirements",
          "description": "Requirements for residential electrical panel upgrades",
          "unit_of_measure": "text"
        },
        "value": "200A minimum for new construction; upgrade permit required",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 5,
      "total": 3,
      "total_pages": 1
    }
  }
}
```

You can combine `category_ids` with other filters like `state_codes` or `data_point_type_ids` to further narrow results. For example, `category_ids=1,5` returns data points from both the Electrical and Fire disciplines.

## Categories in collections

When you create a [collection](/concepts/collections) in the Fordje platform, you can include category IDs as part of its definition. The collection then acts as a reusable filter that automatically scopes data pulls to the disciplines you specified.

This is useful when your team repeatedly needs the same set of categories across different projects. Instead of passing `category_ids` in every API call, you define the categories once in a collection and execute it against whatever AHJs you need.

<Tip>
  Collections can combine category IDs with specific data point type IDs for even more precise filtering. See the [collections concept page](/concepts/collections) for the full workflow.
