Categories are regulatory topics that organize data points into logical groupings. Every data point type in Fordje belongs to one or more categories — Permitting, Inspections, Building Standards, Zoning & Land Use, and others. They give you a way to scope your queries to the topic you care about, so you are not sifting through thousands of unrelated requirements.

When you are building an integration around permitting workflows, you do not need zoning data in your response. Categories let you express that intent directly in the API call.

## Available categories

Each category contains data point types that relate to that regulatory topic. Here are some examples:

| Category | Example data points |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Permitting** | Permit application requirements, fee schedules, turnaround times |
| **Inspections** | Inspection frequency, required inspection types, scheduling rules |
| **Building Standards** | Minimum insulation R-value, fire sprinkler requirements, structural load requirements |
| **Zoning & Land Use** | Setback requirements, lot coverage limits, height restrictions |
| **Licensing & Contractor Requirements** | Contractor license requirements, bonding requirements, insurance minimums |
| **HVAC & Mechanical** | HVAC permit requirements, duct insulation standards, equipment efficiency minimums |

<Info>
  This list is not exhaustive. Use the `GET /v1/categories` endpoint to retrieve the full, up-to-date list of categories programmatically.
</Info>

Note that some data point types appear in more than one category. Fire sprinkler requirements, for example, are relevant to both Building Standards and Inspections.

## How categories help you

Categories solve a practical problem: the Fordje platform tracks a large number of data point types across many regulatory topics. If you query data points for an AHJ without any filtering, you get everything — permitting, inspections, building standards, zoning, licensing, and more. For most integrations, that is far more data than you need.

By passing `category_ids` when you query data points, you tell the API to return only the data points that belong to those topics. This keeps your responses smaller, your parsing simpler, and your application focused on the requirements that actually matter for the work at hand.

<Tip>
  If you know the exact questions you need, filter by `data_point_type_ids` instead. Categories are best when you want everything within a topic without having to enumerate individual types.
</Tip>

## Listing categories

To see all available categories, call the categories endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/categories?page_size=10" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Retrieved 5 category(ies)",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      { "id": 53, "name": "Permitting" },
      { "id": 57, "name": "Building Standards" },
      { "id": 63, "name": "Inspections" },
      { "id": 56, "name": "Zoning & Land Use" },
      { "id": 62, "name": "HVAC & Mechanical" }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 10,
      "total": 14,
      "total_pages": 2
    }
  }
}
```

Each category has an `id` and a `name`. Use the `id` when filtering data points or defining collections.

## Filtering data points by category

Pass one or more category IDs to the data points endpoint to narrow your results to a specific topic. For example, to get permitting data points for a specific AHJ:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points?ahj_ids=1&category_ids=53&page_size=5" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Retrieved 3 data point(s)",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 2010,
        "ahj": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "City of Los Angeles",
          "type": "city",
          "state_code": "CA"
        },
        "data_point_type": {
          "id": 10,
          "name": "Permit Required",
          "description": "Whether a permit is required for this work type",
          "unit_of_measure": "boolean"
        },
        "value": "Yes",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
      },
      {
        "id": 2011,
        "ahj": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "City of Los Angeles",
          "type": "city",
          "state_code": "CA"
        },
        "data_point_type": {
          "id": 14,
          "name": "Permit Turnaround Time",
          "description": "Typical turnaround time for permit approval",
          "unit_of_measure": "text"
        },
        "value": "4-6 weeks for residential; 8-12 weeks for commercial",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 5,
      "total": 3,
      "total_pages": 1
    }
  }
}
```

You can combine `category_ids` with other filters like `state_codes` or `data_point_type_ids` to further narrow results. For example, `category_ids=53,63` returns data points from both the Permitting and Inspections categories.

## Categories in collections

When you create a [collection](/concepts/collections) in the Fordje platform, you can include category IDs as part of its definition. The collection then acts as a reusable filter that automatically scopes data pulls to the topics you specified.

This is useful when your team repeatedly needs the same set of categories across different projects. Instead of passing `category_ids` in every API call, you define the categories once in a collection and execute it against whatever AHJs you need.

<Tip>
  Collections can combine category IDs with specific data point type IDs for even more precise filtering. See the [collections concept page](/concepts/collections) for the full workflow.
