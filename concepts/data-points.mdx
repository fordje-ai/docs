title: "Data Points"
description: "The individual regulatory requirements tracked for each jurisdiction — the core data in Fordje"
---

Every jurisdiction in the United States sets its own rules for building codes, permitting, inspections, and utility interconnection. A data point is a single regulatory requirement tracked for a specific AHJ. It answers one question about one jurisdiction's code — and the same question can have a completely different answer from one city to the next.

Data points are the core data in Fordje. When you query the API, you are retrieving data points: the specific, structured answers to regulatory questions across thousands of jurisdictions.

## What a data point looks like in practice

Data points span every regulatory topic that touches construction and energy regulation. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions Fordje tracks:

| Example question | Category | Format |
|-----------------|----------|--------|
| Is a permit required for re-roofing? | Permitting | Boolean |
| Minimum insulation R-value | Building Standards | Numeric |
| How often are inspections required? | Inspections | Text |
| Utility interconnection voltage threshold | Utility & Interconnection | Numeric |
| Solar panel setback distance from roof edge | Residential Solar - Product | Numeric |
| Maximum lot coverage percentage | Zoning & Land Use | Numeric |
| Contractor license requirements | Licensing & Contractor Requirements | Text |

Each of these questions might have a different answer in Los Angeles than it does in Houston, and a different answer again in Phoenix. Fordje tracks all of them so you do not have to.

## Types vs values

Data points have two parts: the **type** and the **value**.

The **type** is the question. "Is a permit required for re-roofing?" is a data point type. Types are global reference data — they are not scoped to any particular AHJ. The full catalog of types is the same regardless of which jurisdictions you are subscribed to.

The **value** is a specific jurisdiction's answer to that question. "Yes" in Los Angeles, "No" in Houston. Values are always tied to an AHJ.

When you query `GET /v1/data-points`, each item in the response includes both the type (nested as `data_point_type`) and the value:

```json
{
  "id": 1001,
  "ahj": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "City of Los Angeles",
    "type": "city",
    "state_code": "CA"
  },
  "data_point_type": {
    "id": 10,
    "name": "Permit Required",
    "description": "Whether a permit is required for this work type",
    "unit_of_measure": "boolean"
  },
  "value": "Yes",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
}
```

<Info>
  You can browse all available data point types with `GET /v1/data-points/types` without needing to specify any AHJ. This is useful for discovering what questions Fordje tracks before querying specific jurisdictions.

## Units of measure

Every data point type has a unit of measure that tells you how to interpret the value. The API returns the unit on each `data_point_type` object.

| Unit | Description | Example value |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Boolean** | Yes/No answer | `"Yes"` |
| **Text** | Free-form text description | `"Annual inspection required for systems over 5kW"` |
| **Numeric** | Number, often with implied physical units | `"38"` (R-value) |
| **Currency (USD)** | Dollar amount | `"150.00"` |
| **Percentage** | Percentage value | `"80"` |

<Tip>
  Use the `GET /v1/units-of-measure` endpoint to retrieve the full list of units programmatically. See the [reference data API docs](/api-reference/introduction) for details.
</Tip>

## Filtering data points

The `GET /v1/data-points` endpoint supports several filters to narrow your query:

| Filter | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `ahj_ids` | Return data points for specific jurisdictions (comma-separated AHJ IDs) |
| `state_codes` | Return data points for all AHJs in one or more states (e.g. `CA,TX`) |
| `data_point_type_ids` | Return values for specific questions only (comma-separated type IDs) |
| `category_ids` | Return data points belonging to specific regulatory topics (e.g. Permitting, Inspections) |

You can combine these filters. For example, to get all permitting data points across California:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points?state_codes=CA&category_ids=53" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

<Note>
  Results are always scoped to the AHJs in your subscription. If you filter by a state, you will only see data for the AHJs within that state that your organization has access to. See [AHJs](/concepts/ahjs) for details.
</Note>

Categories classify data point types into regulatory topics like Permitting, Inspections, Building Standards, and Zoning & Land Use. You can browse the full list with `GET /v1/categories`. See the [reference data docs](/api-reference/introduction) for more.

## Discovering what is available

Different AHJs have different sets of data points depending on what Fordje has catalogued for that jurisdiction. Not every jurisdiction will have a value for every data point type.

To see what data points exist for a specific AHJ, filter by its ID:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points?ahj_ids=1&page_size=5" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Retrieved 5 data point(s)",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 1001,
        "ahj": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "City of Los Angeles",
          "type": "city",
          "state_code": "CA"
        },
        "data_point_type": {
          "id": 10,
          "name": "Permit Required",
          "description": "Whether a permit is required for this work type",
          "unit_of_measure": "boolean"
        },
        "value": "Yes",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 5,
      "total": 42,
      "total_pages": 9
    }
  }
}
```

To browse the global catalog of data point types (the questions, without jurisdiction-specific values):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points/types?page_size=5" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```json
{
  "response_type": "success",
  "description": "Retrieved 5 data point type(s)",
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": 10,
        "name": "Permit Required",
        "description": "Whether a permit is required for this work type",
        "unit_of_measure": "boolean"
      },
      {
        "id": 20,
        "name": "Inspection Frequency",
        "description": "How often inspections are required",
        "unit_of_measure": "text"
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "page_size": 5,
      "total": 85,
      "total_pages": 17
    }
  }
}
```
