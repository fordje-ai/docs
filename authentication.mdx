All Fordje Connect API endpoints require authentication via an API key passed in the `X-API-Key` request header.

## Including your API key

<Snippet file="auth-header.mdx" />

```bash
curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/ahjs" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

## Error responses

If the API key is missing or invalid, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "response_type": "error",
  "description": "Invalid or missing API key",
  "error": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "status_code": 401
}
```

## Key management

API keys are managed through your organization's Fordje admin portal. From there you can:

- Create new API keys
- View existing keys
- Rotate keys (generates a new key and revokes the old one)
- Revoke keys that are no longer needed

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Never expose them in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

## Key scoping

Each API key is associated with an organization. The key inherits the organization's AHJ subscription, which determines which AHJs you can access through the API. See [AHJ Access Control](/concepts/ahj-access) for details.
