description: "Programmatic access to building code data, organized by jurisdiction — look up, compare, and export code requirements across the AHJs your organization subscribes to."
---

Building codes vary across thousands of jurisdictions. Keeping track of which rules apply where is manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Fordje Connect gives you programmatic access to building code data organized by jurisdiction — so you can look up, compare, and export code requirements across any Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) your organization subscribes to.

## What you'll find in Fordje

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJs)">
    AHJs are the cities, counties, and states that write and enforce building codes. Every piece of data in Fordje is tied to a specific AHJ. Your organization subscribes to the AHJs relevant to your work, and Fordje Connect scopes all data to that subscription.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data points">
    Data points are the individual code requirements tracked in Fordje. A data point is a specific question about a jurisdiction's code — like "What is the minimum insulation R-value?" or "Is a permit required for re-roofing?" Each data point has a value that can differ from one AHJ to another.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collections">
    Collections are saved configurations that define which data points to pull. Think of a collection as a reusable template — you define the set of questions once, then run it against any group of AHJs to get answers. Collections are created in the Fordje web app and executed through Fordje Connect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reports">
    Reports are side-by-side comparisons of code requirements across jurisdictions. Use reports to generate comparison matrices (AHJs on one axis, data points on the other) or export data as CSV for use in your own tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trade groups">
    Trade groups are professional disciplines — like Electrical, Plumbing, or Mechanical — used to organize data points. Filter by trade group to focus on the code requirements relevant to your work.
