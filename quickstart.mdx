---

This guide walks you through your first few API calls to Fordje Connect. By the end, you'll have retrieved jurisdiction data, queried code requirements, and generated a comparison report.

## Prerequisites

- You need an API key from your Fordje account. If you don't have one, contact your organization administrator.
- Your API key determines which Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) records you can access — you'll only see data for jurisdictions your organization subscribes to.

<Steps>
  <Step title="See your jurisdictions">
    Let's start by seeing which AHJs your organization has access to.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/ahjs?page=1&page_size=10" \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
    ```

    ```python Python
    import requests

    response = requests.get(
        "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/ahjs",
        headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
        params={"page": 1, "page_size": 10},
    )
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/ahjs?page=1&page_size=10",
      {
        headers: { "X-API-Key": "your-api-key" },
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    You'll receive a response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "response_type": "success",
      "description": "Retrieved 10 AHJ(s)",
      "data": {
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "City of Los Angeles",
            "type": "city",
            "state_code": "CA"
          }
        ],
        "pagination": {
          "page": 1,
          "page_size": 10,
          "total": 142,
          "total_pages": 15
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Each AHJ has an `id` you'll use in later requests, along with its name, type (city, county, or state), and `state_code`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Look up code requirements">
    Now let's query some actual code data. Data points are the individual code requirements tracked in Fordje — things like permit requirements, insulation values, or inspection rules.

    Plug these data points into your sales, design, engineering, or permitting tool so you have accurate data points exactly where you need them. Or pull a full set into your CRM at the start of a project.

    You can filter data points by AHJ IDs, state, or category. Here's how to pull data points for two specific jurisdictions:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points?ahj_ids=1,2&page_size=5" \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
    ```

    ```python Python
    response = requests.get(
        "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points",
        headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
        params={"ahj_ids": "1,2", "page_size": 5},
    )
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/data-points?ahj_ids=1,2&page_size=5",
      {
        headers: { "X-API-Key": "your-api-key" },
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    You'll receive a response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "response_type": "success",
      "description": "Retrieved 5 data point(s)",
      "data": {
        "items": [
          {
            "ahj": {
              "id": 1,
              "name": "City of Los Angeles",
              "type": "city",
              "state_code": "CA"
            },
            "data_point_type": {
              "id": 10,
              "name": "Permit Required",
              "description": "Whether a permit is required for this work type",
              "unit_of_measure": "boolean"
            },
            "value": "Yes",
            "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
          }
        ],
        "pagination": {
          "page": 1,
          "page_size": 5,
          "total": 12,
          "total_pages": 3
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Each item pairs an AHJ with a data point type and its value for that jurisdiction.

    <Info>
      You can also filter by `state` (e.g., `state=CA`) or `category_ids` to narrow results to a specific discipline like Electrical or Plumbing. See the [data points API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for all available filters.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull a curated set with collections">
    Once you know which data points matter for your workflow, save them as a collection in the Fordje platform. Then execute that collection through the API to pull exactly the data you need — no extra filtering required.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X GET "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/collections/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/data?ahj_ids=1,2,3&page_size=10" \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
    ```

    ```python Python
    response = requests.get(
        "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/collections/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/data",
        headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"},
        params={"ahj_ids": "1,2,3", "page_size": 10},
    )
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/collections/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/data?ahj_ids=1,2,3&page_size=10",
      {
        headers: { "X-API-Key": "your-api-key" },
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    You'll receive a response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "response_type": "success",
      "description": "Collection 'Electrical Permits' executed: 6 result(s)",
      "data": {
        "collection_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
        "collection_name": "Electrical Permits",
        "items": [
          {
            "ahj": { "id": 1, "name": "City of Los Angeles" },
            "data_point_type": { "id": 10, "name": "Permit Required" },
            "value": "Yes",
            "updated_at": "2025-01-10T08:30:00Z"
          }
        ],
        "pagination": {
          "page": 1,
          "page_size": 10,
          "total": 6,
          "total_pages": 1
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The response includes only the data points defined in the collection, scoped to the AHJs you specified. Use collections to standardize the data you pull across projects — define once, run anywhere.

    <Tip>
      To see which collections your organization has set up, call `GET /v1/collections`. See the [collections API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for details.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare across jurisdictions">
    One of the most powerful features of Fordje Connect is comparing code requirements across multiple jurisdictions at once. Reports let you build a matrix — jurisdictions on one side, code requirements on the other.

    Quickly see where you can easily expand into or provide a full list of requirements for all current projects to your teams.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/reports/matrix" \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "ahj_ids": [1, 2, 3],
        "data_point_type_ids": [10, 20, 30]
      }'
    ```

    ```python Python
    response = requests.post(
        "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/reports/matrix",
        headers={
            "X-API-Key": "your-api-key",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        json={
            "ahj_ids": [1, 2, 3],
            "data_point_type_ids": [10, 20, 30],
        },
    )
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    ```

    ```javascript JavaScript
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://connect.fordje.com/v1/reports/matrix",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "X-API-Key": "your-api-key",
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          ahj_ids: [1, 2, 3],
          data_point_type_ids: [10, 20, 30],
        }),
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    You'll receive a response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "response_type": "success",
      "description": "Generated matrix for 3 AHJ(s)",
      "data": {
        "rows": [
          {
            "ahj": { "id": 1, "name": "City of Los Angeles" },
            "values": {
              "10": "Yes",
              "20": "Annual",
              "30": "$150.00"
            }
          },
          {
            "ahj": { "id": 2, "name": "City of Houston" },
            "values": {
              "10": "Yes",
              "20": "Biannual",
              "30": "$125.00"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    Each row is an AHJ, and each key in `values` maps to a data point type ID — giving you a side-by-side comparison of how each jurisdiction handles each code requirement.

    <Tip>
      You can also export report data as CSV using the `POST /v1/reports/export` endpoint. See the [reports API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for details.
